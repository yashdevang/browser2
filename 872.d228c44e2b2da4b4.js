Securely attached adults tend to believe that romantic love is enduring.

They're comfortable with intimacy, and understand if partners need time or space away from them.

"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(31,"p",11),e._uU(32," Such attachment is associated with needy/clingy behavior, such as getting very anxious when your partner doesn't text back fast enough and constantly feeling like your partner doesn't care enough about you. They may subconsciously choose avoidant partners and fall into a victim mindset when needs are not met. They do not have a strong individual identity and try to merge with their partner. They could become suspicious and jealous of their partners easily and need constant reassurance that their partner loves them. They usually have low self-esteem, are moody, emotional, and hypersensitive. They often fear that their partner will cheat on them or leave them and this behaviour pushes partners away.

Alternatively, they may want to fill that void as quickly as possible by seeking a new partner.

Avoidant attachment style "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(43,"p",13),e._uU(44," Avoidant attachment style is another form of insecure attachment style marked by a fear of intimacy and mistrust of people in general. Those with avoidant attachment styles describe love as rare and temporary. This type could potentially have a fear of abandonment deep down but his/her fear of engulfment is much more strong and apparent than the fear of abandonment. They often feel smothered and suffocated in relationships and want to maintain individuality in relationships rather than being \u201cconsumed\u201d by a relationship. In some cases, they could often fear relationships because it\u2019s too much of a responsibility to keep it going and often deep down have a fear of hurting their partner because they may not be able to fulfil promises of commitment and of fulfilling their needs. They usually maintain some distance from their partners or are largely emotionally unavailable in their relationships, preferring to be independent and rely on themselves. They often find themselves in a relationship with an anxious attachment style. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(45,"p",13),e._uU(46," Their relationship with their own self is of more significance than their relationships with others. Those with an avoidant attachment tend to have difficulty with intimacy and close relationships. These individuals do not invest much emotion in relationships and experience little distress when a relationship ends. However, it\u2019s not as if they are able to successfully move on from that relationship either. Since they repress uncomfortable emotions, they often carry a lot of baggage and unresolved emotions into subsequent relationships. They may continue to be cold and distant and tend to suffer the consequences of that baggage in their own way. They may feel stuck, numb or unsettled or fear rejection, often turning to distractions like video games, TV series, work etc. They feel lonely too but this need is often denied. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(47,"p",13),e._uU(48," They often avoid intimacy by using excuses such as busy with work or may fantasize about other people during sex. Research has also shown that adults with an avoidant attachment style are more accepting of and likely to engage in casual sex. Other common characteristics include a failure to support partners during stressful times and an inability to share feelings, thoughts, and emotions with partners. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(49,"p",13),e._uU(50," This style develops when parents are not responsive, and they are often dismissive and distant. Sometimes, such a style also develops when parents are involved but are controlling and manipulative. People having this attachment style have trouble getting close to others or trusting others in relationships for this reason. The child learns very early in life to not depend on others for his/her needs. These were the children, who would feel assured being by themselves in the playground, not caring at all if they had caregivers around. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(51,"p",13),e._uU(52," To overcome this attachment style, one must first connect with self and one\u2019s emotions.

Fearful or disorganized attachment "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(55,"p",13),e._uU(56," Fearful attachment style is a combination of both the anxious and avoidant attachment styles. People with fearful attachment want affection but also want to avoid it. They're hesitant to develop a close romantic relationship, but they have a strong need to feel loved by others. People with disorganised attachment styles find it difficult to trust themselves as well as others. They are constantly worried about being hurt by loved ones. Feeling unsafe, walking on eggshells, constantly apologising are some of the common signs. They have a chronic fear that the one they love might change its colours one day. They have a very apparent fear of abandonment and try to avoid relationships not because they fear engulfment like in Avoidant or losing themselves in a relationship but because they fear that the other person could leave them. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(57,"p",13),e._uU(58," Here, the relationship with self and relationship with others are equally affected - often leading to the person feeling emotionally dysregulated as they don\u2019t have any to hold on to. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(59,"p",13),e._uU(60," They have a low self esteem and could have other mental health issues such as addictions, thinking in extremes (black and white thinking), anxiety etc. They are the most likely to enter into a relationship with other people of the same attachment style leading to a constant push-pull dynamic in which partners break up and then get back with each other. This style also mourns the breakup significantly especially if they weren\u2019t the ones breaking up and that could push them into depression. They may also be codependents in certain relationships and paradoxically don\u2019t seek to avoid intimacy directly but by seeking other emotionally unavailable partners. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(61,"p",13),e._uU(62," This style is likely to occur if parents were abusive to them. Narcissistic abuse, emotional incest (children acting as a caregiver to parents) often leads to this attachment style. They have unresolved memories and emotions from losses from the past that have not been not mourned properly. There could be a need to avoid processing the immense grief of prior traumas. As children, these are often in a confused state and may experience a \u201cfreeze\u201d response where they may not know how to form a relationship with the caregiver. Because the caregiver may often be abusive and volatile, they often try to become very attuned to the mood of the caregiver. For this reason, they might be good at reading certain people and may be drawn to healing professions (\u201cwounded healer\u201d archetype). "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(63,"p",13),e._uU(64," To overcome this one can be a part of communities that make them feel safe. Communities such as a listening group, mental health volunteer groups etc. When one finds people they feel safe with, they will gradually learn to trust people as this is often the hardest attachment style to overcome. Working on trauma, self-esteem and learning to trust oneself is also helpful. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(65,"h4",15),e._uU(66," Solution "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(67,"p",16),e._uU(68," It is possible for a person to change their attachment style. As per the research, one out of four persons changes their attachment style every 4 years - often without intending to. If one wants to move towards a more secure attachment style, they are needed to work, have patience, and most importantly have a firm intention of shifting from an insecure to a secure attachment style. This can be done by identifying one\u2019s patterns, working on them and taking counselling if needed. When children are raised with confidence that their parents will be available to them, they are less likely to experience fear than those who are raised without such conviction. Such confidence is forged during a critical period of development, during the years of infancy, childhood, and adolescence. "),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(69,"p",17),e._uU(70," The expectations that are formed during that period tend to remain relatively stable for the rest of the person's life unless one works on changing that. These expectations that are formed are directly tied to experience. In other words, children develop expectations that their parents will be responsive to their needs because, in their experience, their parents have been responsive in the past. However, attachment styles formed during early childhood are not necessarily identical to those demonstrated in adult romantic attachments. A great deal of time has elapsed between infancy and adulthood, so intervening experiences, especially the first romantic relationship or the \u201cfirst love\u201d, can also play a large role in adult attachment styles. Those described as insecure during childhood can become securely attached as adults, while those with a secure attachment in childhood can show insecure attachment patterns in adulthood.
