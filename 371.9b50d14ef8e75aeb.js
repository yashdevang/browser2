Such children tend to be extremely suspicious of strangers. These children display considerable distress when separated from a parent or caregiver, but do not seem reassured or comforted by the return of the parent. In some cases, the child might passively reject the parent by refusing comfort, or may openly display direct aggression toward the parent.

"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(21,"p",7),e._uU(22," Another way that a child develops an insecure attachment style is when parents do not respond, and they are often distant or cold or dismissive, then they're consistently emotionally disconnected from their child- this results in the child believing that their needs won't get met and this pattern can continue in adult relationships. Children with avoidant attachment styles tend to avoid parents and caregivers. This avoidance often becomes especially pronounced after a period of absence. These children might not reject attention from a parent, but neither do they seek out comfort or contact. Children with an avoidant attachment show no preference between a parent and a complete stranger. At school, they may avoid or have minimal interaction with other children.

"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(25,"p",7),e._uU(26," Another manner in which one develops an insecure attachment is if a parent/ both parents are abusive, frightening or traumatizing, but sometimes loving leading the child to experience a deep sense of fear and a lack of trust in others despite wanting close connections. Children with a disorganized-insecure attachment style show a lack of clear attachment behavior. Their actions and responses to caregivers are often a mix of behaviors, including avoidance or resistance. These children are described as displaying dazed behavior, sometimes seeming either confused or apprehensive in the presence of a caregiver. They may take on a parental role and may act as a caregiver toward the parent. Inconsistent behavior on the part of parents might be a contributing factor in this style of attachment. Parents who act as figures of both fear and reassurance to a child contribute to a disorganized attachment style. Since the child feels both comforted and frightened by the parent, confusion results.
