Adults with ADHD are frequently inattentive, forgetful, and lack impulse control. Because ADHD is an "invisible disability," often going unnoticed by individuals who are inexperienced with the illness, socially unacceptable actions caused by ADHD symptoms are frequently misattributed to other causes. People generally see these actions and the person who engages in them as impolite, self-centered, reckless, lazy, ill-mannered, and a variety of other unfavorable personality traits. Such unfavorable designations eventually lead to societal rejection of the individual with ADHD. Many children and adults with ADHD experience emotional suffering as a result of social rejection, which can cause turmoil and reduced self-esteem throughout their lives. In relationships and marriages, incorrect social behavior may irritate the partner or spouse who does not have ADHD, causing them to "burn out" and give up on the relationship or marriage.

Social phobia is a severe anticipatory anxiety that you will embarrass or humiliate yourself in public, or that the outside world will judge you harshly. Rejection sensitivity is difficult to distinguish. People frequently lack the vocabulary to explain its pain. They describe it as severe, awful, horrific, and overwhelming.

It is a characteristic shared by people with ADHD. Hypersensitivity symptoms include being overly sensitive to physical (through sound, sigh, touch, or smell) and/or emotional stimuli, as well as being easily intimidated by too much information. Sensory overload can be a sign of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sensory overload happens when one or more senses are overstimulated in some way. Furthermore, people with ADHD and sensory overload may find it difficult to swiftly "switch gears" in terms of the activity in which they are participating. They may also have difficulty registering new stimuli or changes in their environment. When something unexpected happens, this could lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed. After being exposed to a trigger, some people with sensory overload are unable to operate normally until their senses return to normal. In extreme circumstances, they may feel actual discomfort from seemingly innocuous things like a gentle touch or the ability to hear multiple simultaneous conversations.
