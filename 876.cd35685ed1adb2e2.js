However, some, especially men may have some difficulty in social situations, understanding emotions, tone, and pitch of others voice. High functioning autistic women are less likely to have difficulties in social settings, but there are exceptions. Most high functioning autistic individuals consider themselves logical and practical. They may have trouble understanding jokes, sarcasm, and take things literally. They may fixate on certain things, objects, patterns, concepts and expect that others will be as interested in them as they are. They do not like any disruption in their routine and get very agitated when it happens. They may also be more sensitive to sensory stimuli such as sound, light, touch, smell, taste. They will be able to hear, see, smell better than most people and hence, what is normal for most may be too loud or bright or harsh for them. They may also want more space and do not like when others get too close or in their personal space. They may not like interacting with others much and prefer to be by themselves. They are also more likely to be paranoid about government, thinking that they may be followed, monitored, believe in conspiracy theories, and have a greater fear of catching a disease than most people.

They are anxious in social situations. They enjoy doing repetitive things in life such as having the same meal, reading the same book, watching the same show or being around the same people.

Occupational therapy can help them learn how to use hands, legs, or other body parts more efficiently to make performing daily tasks easier. Sensory training can help them become more comfortable with sensory input such as sounds, lights. Applied behavioral analysis can help by encouraging desired behaviors using a reward system while decreasing behaviors that interfere with functionality of the individual. Meditation practices can help deal with anxiety in people with autism spectrum. It is also useful to not label oneself as having a disorder and believing it to be permanent.
