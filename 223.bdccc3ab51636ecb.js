Some people procrastinate as they feel a lack of energy or are too lethargic to participate in any activities. Others become a part of this vicious cycle as they fear they might do something wrong or are not good at it, their neural pathways have been working around these cognitive distortions which keep on rolling around in a cyclic nature. Many times individuals learn such behaviors as a result of imitational learning which have been reinforced by the surroundings so it adds value and confirmation to their behavioral pattern. Individuals also tend to procrastinate as a result of the diffusion of responsibility which is a socio psychological phenomenon wherein a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when other bystanders or witnesses are present.
