The repetitive thoughts can be for instance, \u2018I am dirty or this is dirty\u2019 or \u2018I did not turn off the stove\u2019 etc., and the resulting repetitive behaviors can be hand washing, cleaning, checking on things, etc. This can significantly interfere with a person\u2019s daily activities and social interactions if the obsessions and the compulsions are very frequent and intense. Performing the compulsive behaviour does not give them any joy, however, not performing the behaviour will trigger anxiety and distress by an increase in obsessive thoughts. Often, they have superstitious OCD such as- thinking that they should speak only 7 words in a sentence and avoid 13 because of luck factors.

An important thing to realise here is that not taking action because of fear of doing the wrong thing may sometimes prevent one from even doing the right thing. This can exacerbate guilt - particularly that of the existential kind. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and habit reversal training can be very effective in treating OCD. Exposure and Response Prevention Technique is also very effective. In this technique, people are asked to face situations that trigger compulsions, for instance touching anything dirty and then being prevented from undertaking the compulsion, for example, handwashing).
