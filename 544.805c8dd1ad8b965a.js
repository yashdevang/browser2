The mother could be an alcoholic, a drug abuser, or a smoker. She could be suffering from a severe physical or emotional condition, or she could be the victim of an abusive relationship.

Many physical illnesses, such as asthma or allergies, may be provoked by the physiological response to the fear of annihilation.

Separation anxiety may be very severe, and oral characters might cling on to unsatisfying situations very firmly, often with much whining. People with this personality type frequently project their own needs and desires onto the receiver, ignoring the requests expressed by the receiver. Others frequently perceive what the oral character considers to be the gift of love as a demand for affection. For example, the individual will promise a lot and believe they are delivering it (intention), but recipients will see that the individual does not follow through for one convincing reason or another (results). The communicator then makes many requests that they believe they are entitled to as retaliation. Another method of gaining support is to show oneself as weak and deprived. If rescue is not explicitly sought, the need for it is acted out. Because ineffectiveness is the key to avoiding abandonment, the collapsing communicator can never make it without assistance. Potential rescuers get resentful. Another method of gaining support is through direct, self-righteous demand. The communicator may list numerous injustices and demand that someone take action. These actions\' alienating effects on others appear to repeat the feeling of early abandonment, prompting the person to "give up" on relationships at times. There is a true potential to communicate love, yet relationships are frequently romanticized by the imagination to an impossible height, or are quickly abandoned. Relationships with persons who are exceedingly needy are regularly sought after ("I\'ll take care of you as the needy me that I am not."). Love is associated with both a long-awaited reward and the possibility for suffocation or devouring. Surrendering to love emotions for someone awakens deep concerns of abandonment, falling behind, losing oneself, and being alone. Despite intentional efforts, it is extremely difficult to develop a solid relationship because the communicator is either rejecting wants or portraying needs that are so big that they are unmeetable. In either instance, smooth, reciprocal, \'good enough\' caregiving cannot be developed. There is a strong need for intimacy. In order to experience intimacy, they are willing to give up everything else (control, power, etc.). Having personal relationships is critical to their survival. They must be linked to someone. They are frequently quite romantic. They readily become engrossed in a relationship since they will do practically anything to avoid being abandoned. To stay connected to someone, individuals frequently alter their demeanor and give up their essential ideals.

Art, particularly literature or poetry, is frequently pursued. This can be motivated by emotion, but it can also be motivated by a sense of superiority. Also, because the arts are essentially subjective, they escape comparison with the results of others. The communicator's natural tendency is to find 'the correct thing to do' and do it. As a result, the communicator is morally and socially capable. However, putting good ideas into action can be tough. Communicators have a tendency to focus intensively on their objectives and plans, both past and present, and to dismiss results as insignificant or the responsibility of others. In the world, ideas are untested, and while idealism can sometimes bring fruit, foolish and unrealistic beliefs typically persist.

Childhood dynamics that lead to a needy personality are often those that occur from a lack of mother-attunement with the kid. At this period, the father provides a secondary but still significant role of support and nurturing to both the child and the mother, but the mother is the major defining bond that shapes the child. Typically, there was deprivation or inconsistency on the part of the parents in meeting the child\'s nurturance needs. The Needy personality appears to be undercharged, deflated, "not filled up," or starved of energy, and their body reflects this undercharge, thinness, weakness, or reliance.

The underlying experience is one of being on the point of deprivation and abandonment, and independence is feared because it will result in total abandonment. As the child was exposed to abandonment, he developed an unconscious defense of trying to be independent in order to be accepted by people. Very often, people with this personality trait might initiate becoming independent at a very early age with the thought process of being accepted, as a result of which they might start to achieve their developmental stages way before others of their age. You might find these people started walking, or talking before their developmental age; they try to grow and mature before their age. As a result, the child throughout adult life manifests a lot of energy to become co-dependent, and gives up on expectations from others.

The hostile reactions that occurred along the road in this failing battle for their own existence were ultimately destroyed and disowned, until they became docile and obedient. Resistance was futile and was crushed till it died. The Child\'s wrath at the suppression flowed underground and into his body. The child begins to distrust their own instincts about when they are hungry, when to go to the toilet, how much to eat, and so on, because all of this is now under the supervision and direction of the intrusive parent (s). In this sense, the child learns to distrust and reject their own nature and humanity, preferring instead to be managed and directed by the parent. They lose their sense of self-determination and self-direction. They appear to be good, cooperative, docile, agreeable, and deceptively happy all of the time, yet they are raging on the inside. To force conformity with the adult\'s demands, the parent may frighten the child. This can include threats of punishment, the parent leaving the home and abandoning the child, or the child being thrown out of the house and abandoned by the parent. In many cases, "smothering" rather than "mothering" occurs, and it occurs at the child\'s socialization skill level, but it can also occur around physical intake impulses (eating and drinking) and bodily elimination impulses (Excretion and urination). Basically, if you corrupt the child\'s intake and/or elimination processes, they may begin to lose will and command over such processes and succumb to the parent. The "flow" of these processes is frequently disrupted, resulting in excessive food or drink intake under parental compulsion or pressure to eliminate according to predetermined timelines. Sometimes the infant begins to "hold in," and the body takes on a "pressure cooker" appearance, which corresponds to the Endurer\'s inner psychic world, which fears intrusion, control, smothering, and loss of freedom by others. The Endurer appears in life as a self-depreciating, self-defeating, and frequently self-torturing or self-humiliating individual who appears to have a need to suffer and torture others in their pain. This personality type will have a need to whine and complain, as well as a sense of sorrow or a lack of genuine pleasure.

In other words, even though he is deeply upset, he may not cry because that would mean a loss of power. This is especially evident in the feminine form, as sexuality is leveraged to gain dominance. Sexual pleasure is less essential than performance. She uses her charm to appear weak at first, but after she has gained strength, she will dominate. She can be seductive at first, then dominant and deadly in the end. She always needs to be one up better than others around her. She will surround herself with foolish and naive people.

The submissive psychopath essentially desires something from others, such as love and acceptance, frequently from someone of the same sex. This is due to the infant\'s lack of basic assistance, which he now aspires to find in adulthood. However, when a personality becomes submissive, it abandons its own self, its beliefs, intuitive impulses, and honesty. Unable to defend himself, the individual undermines his own integrity and reinforces a deeply ingrained sense of worthlessness and self-contempt. This vicious cycle debases personality, reduces remaining self-esteem, and increases the need for outside affection, validation, and support. As the vicious spiral continues, the personality grows more and more reliant and demanding in a subtle manner, attempting to force others to give him what he is unwilling to ask for. As a result, the individual becomes highly self-centered and oblivious to reality and the needs of those around him. People retreat in a reactive manner, providing less and less love, support, and validation, which expands the cycle and keeps it going. The subservient psychopath will frequently disguise his dependent neediness as affection. He is perplexed as to why this apparent love is not reciprocated by others.

The achiever may connect with this as being superior as a man and develop 'Don Juan' conduct in response to it. Inspirer characters frequently exhibit Don Juan behavior as a result of incomplete discharge, although in that instance, the pelvis as well as the genitals are confined.

This parent's role is to be aware of this evolving dynamic and to work skillfully with it so that the child is not rejected, used, punished, or disgraced for having natural heart impulses and sexuality. The child discovers that it is dangerous to love sexually with an open heart and to encounter natural human rivalry.
