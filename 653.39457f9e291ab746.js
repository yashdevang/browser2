Those with anxious biotype are prone to worrying and being afraid about their future. They are likely to have restlessness, insomnia, and anhedonia, that is not enjoying what one used to enjoy earlier. Those with dull biotype react to depression by ruminating over the past and feeling sad about it. They also get tired more often and experience lack of energy.

It also affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of severe emotional, physical and behavioural problems. Depressed people may have severe trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living. Very often most of us feel stressed when a lot needs to be done in a lesser amount of time and if we are low on energy. However, depression is a state wherein one feels so for a very long time and feel like giving up everything coupled with feelings of anxiety, shame, loss of purpose and meaningfulness. In severe cases, people may resort to self-harming by cutting, burning oneself or even killing oneself. What one needs to remember is that depression is not a permanent state. Taking support from loved ones and talking about your issues with them can help you cope. Learning better coping mechanisms for stress will also help immensely. For instance, when stressed due to relationships or work, instead of drinking, one can try watching comedy. Exercising, meditating, yoga, deep breathing have shown to be immensely helpful. Avoiding stressors when possible can also help to cut down the unpleasant emotions. One must not be shy to seek professional help. If you know of someone whom you suspect is depressed, encourage them to seek help."),e._UZ(82,"br"),e.qZA()(),e.TgZ(83,"div",5)(84,"p",4),e._uU(85," 1.
