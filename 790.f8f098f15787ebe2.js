The praise, admiration and validation also termed \u201cnarcissistic supply\u201d is freely received for their false self i.e. the grandiose version of themselves that they have built and not their true (more vulnerable, flawed) self, which is often inaccessible even to them due to the large barrage of defenses that they have build over time.
