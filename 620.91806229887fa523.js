People with BPD experience intense emotions and for extended periods of time, have a hard time returning to the baseline after the event that emotionally triggered them. This often leads to impulsivity, fluctuating self-esteem and risky behaviors with stormy relationships. They feel an extreme sense of insecurity and instability, have an intense fear of abandonment, inappropriate anger and impulsiveness which push others away and counters their need for having loving and lasting relationships. Some aspects related to development of personality may put one at the risk of this disorder. If you have a high score on most dimensions, you can visit a clinical psychologist to help you.
