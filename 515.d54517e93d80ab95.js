Neurotic people are being very self-conscious and shy, it reflects emotional instability. A neurotic person tends to have trouble dealing with stress, finds it difficult to calm down when worried, and carries a lot of self-doubt leading to extreme moodiness or irritability. There is a chronic worry about a set of diverse things in the mind and feels overwhelmed by minor setbacks, hence becoming envious of how others have it easier than them. In an uncomfortable situation a neurotic person blames himself and feels guilty for being the cause leading to the situation, ending up with fear of abandonment by others. Neuroticism is often rooted in lack of a self-concept and can be reduced to a certain extent by therapy, self-love and self-forgiveness.
